        <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%B2%8C%EB%A6%B4%EB%9D%BC_%EA%B0%80%EB%93%9C%EB%8B%9D" target="_blank">Guerrilla gardening</a> is the act of gardening on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to cultivate, such as abandoned sites, areas that are not being cared for, or private property. It encompasses a diverse range of people and motivations, ranging from gardeners who spill over their legal boundaries to gardeners with political influences who seek to provoke change by using guerrilla gardening as a form of protest or direct action. This practice has implications for land rights and land reform; aiming to promote re-consideration of land ownership in order to assign a new purpose or reclaim land that is perceived to be in neglect or misused.</p>
